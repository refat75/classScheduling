# Class Scheduling

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Idea:

1. Set Up a button Called (Available) in the user Availability page.
   Which has two color Green and Red. In Every Click it change its state. Also in admin section there is a segment to show Available teacher and the admin can't select Unavailable teacher for any Class;
